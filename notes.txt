Questions:
-----
    - Manual student add. We talked about adding a ID of some sort to the 'Notes' when adding a student.
        - However, Health insurance main reports DO NOT have a notes column

    - New reports like compare, will there ever be the same student on a new report that has new info that the baseline
        does not have ?

Potential problems
-----
    - excel column names changing 
    - Process logic (What rows are we grabbing ? And what columns, and what do they map too ?)
        - Auto-populated values (insurance - destin country / destin city - Give 'column name': value) ? Or hard code logic ?

    



 - TODO
    - Account fees settings
        - How we determine whether we are going for fall, winter, summer
        - Fee columns to target ?


    - Process in progress-loading indicator
    - Process finished UX display of some sort...
        - info mark bug - infobox doesnt go away and gets really dark lmao
    ***
    -- new column: accounting template --> BALANCE column
        - owing to school: +20
        - school owes student: -20
    - new column: Fee Code -- > ININ (for all accounting...)
    ***

    - TEMPLATES:
        - Done. Don't need delete button... add template just replaces the template
    - test assessment fees comparisons to make sure data type is good, and works in excel
    










Make templates dynamic... Rename, Add new, delete
    - redirect pointer logic...
        - IF logic is suitable for that...

ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
    - Student ID
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Notes

*** just create these excel files when needed or use a template that can be replaceable ?
