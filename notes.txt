// TODO: Tasks

- when a new baseline file is produced some UX to show that...

- Templates + settings page First

    - ESLEAP, ILAC, POSTSECOND logic pointing to a specific file...
        - Hardcoded: the logic for how we add to these templates
        - The logic, will have pointers to the TEMPLATE files
        - We can add / remove templates... but then we just have to go to config tab
        - ESLEAP -> ESLEAPNEW file, etc...

        config UI:
            - ESLEAP --> template
            - ILAC --> template
            - POSTSECOND --> template

        template UI:
            - Display templates available... Grab list of files in templates directory...
            - Click Delete on them, warning message, then delete the file...
            - Insurance templates ------- Add new Templates
                - below we display list of cards.....

        Same for accounting... although that will just be one card probably but still...

        

    - Have templates
    - 

- Processes
    - solo process baseline report ?
    - process compare file against baseline
        - underlying logic for insurance + accounting

- UX stuff... Error display... 
    -  baseline 'updated' beside title
        - 'Last Updated: just now'
        - 'x minutes ago'
        = 'x hours ago'
        - 'straight date, if into a next day...





// DONE: Finished
- Add baseline report...
- Get baseline report on dom load
- rename baseline report...
- download baseline file...



Make templates dynamic... Rename, Add new, delete
    - redirect pointer logic...
        - IF logic is suitable for that...

ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
    - Student ID
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Notes

*** just create these excel files when needed or use a template that can be replaceable ?




Insurance logic
 
    ESL LEAP Insurance
        - Filter 'MAJOR' column field ?

    ILAC insurance
        - 'CAMPUS' column field has "LT"

    Post-Secondary insurance
        - If neither of the others ???


- User needs to be able to download newly created 'insurance' and 'accounting' excels


BASELINE
 - Store baseline .xlxs in 'baseline' folder ?



 - BASELINE should be downloadable at all times
 - We should display, most recent changes to BASELINE
    - BASELINE - ROW amount tracker
    - If we manually add a student... we should see that our baseline rows number, increased...
    - If we have a new cognos report, then we should see, that we added however many rows to it...


Baseline section:
BASELINE
    File name - as a row created
    Rows count, created date, last updated date
    Add new cognos report to 'process report' button --> grayed out if no 'process file' exists...
        - If no baseline, that becomes baseline file and it gets processed...
        - If there is baseline, we compare, add new students to baseline, and process

    *** process one file
    Baseline ( saved in server data folder )
        - Baseline file properties
        - Add new Baseline file
        - Process baseline button
        - rename baseline file
        - download baseline file
    *** process new report against baseline...
    Comparison Report
        - Add new comparison report
        - Process against baseline button


Report processing:
    - possible that any combination of insurance or accounting report are produced based on logic
    - After process,


    REPORTS AVAILABLE section ( populated after report processed...)
    - Insurance Cards in list row (with download button)
    - Accounting on a list row ( with download button)
        - if no report availble, then for that row just show text of... "No report available for last process"



Tabs:
 - Report processing tab
 - Configuration tab ( change semester dynamic, or templates / template logic pointers...)






Read me for application Use:

- Accepts .xlsx, .xls files

- main logic dependencies ( like excel column names and such...)
    -
