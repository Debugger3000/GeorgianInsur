Questions:
-----
    - When we process, do we want to select a single semester ( fall, winter, summer ) ?
        - Then process for that "Fall 2025 Fees Paid" if we choose ''Fall' ?
        - Are we using '2026 Total Fees Paid' or 'Total Fees Paid' column at all ?

    - Can I student have a major of "ESL EAPC" and have "LT" in Campus ? Which insurance do they then get ?
    - Is column 'PR email' in health insurance report the email we want used for 'Insured's Primary Email' ?

    - If you want to add a new template lets say, all functionality will break if hardcoded..

Potential problems
-----
    - Changing cognos column names
        - SOLVED: via process filter logic (we say, 'column name' with X value goes into Y report)
            - We got the row.
            - Now what column data maps to INSUR template columns ?
                - COGNOS [
                    {
                        received_col_name: 'First Name',
                        target_col_name: 'First Name'
                    },
                    {
                        received_col_name: 'PR Email',
                        target_col_name: 'Insured's Primary Email'
                    }
                ]
    - Changing Template column names
        - ^^^^^^^

    - Process logic (What rows are we grabbing ? And what columns, and what do they map too ?)
        - Auto-populated values (insurance - destin country / destin city - Give 'column name': value) ? Or hard code logic ?

    











    - Comparing against baseline
        - Same students on baseline as on new cognos report...
        - CHECK DUPLICATES
        - UPDATE ROWS or delete same student on baseline and then ADD BACK SAME STUDENT ?


    




// TODO: Tasks




- Testing - Processing
    - Accounting ( should produce these students ) 3,5,8,10
        - Fall 2025 - IDs: 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009
        - 

    - ESL EAPC - 'Major' column with 'ESL EAPC'
    - ILAC - 'Campus' column with 'LT'
    - POST Secondary - All who don't match first two Filter











- when a new baseline file is produced some UX to show that...

- Templates + settings page First

    - ESLEAP, ILAC, POSTSECOND logic pointing to a specific file...
        - Hardcoded: the logic for how we add to these templates
        - The logic, will have pointers to the TEMPLATE files
        - We can add / remove templates... but then we just have to go to config tab
        - ESLEAP -> ESLEAPNEW file, etc...

        config UI:
            - ESLEAP --> template
            - ILAC --> template
            - POSTSECOND --> template

        template UI:
            - Display templates available... Grab list of files in templates directory...
            - Click Delete on them, warning message, then delete the file...
            - Insurance templates ------- Add new Templates
                - below we display list of cards.....

        Same for accounting... although that will just be one card probably but still...

        

    - Have templates
    - 

- processing
    - UI CLIENT: Drop down tag (select semester to target in processing ?)
        - Fall, winter, summer ?
        - Cause we are processing based on CURRENT SEMESTER ? We
    - solo process baseline report ?
    - process compare file against baseline
        - underlying logic for insurance + accounting

- UX stuff... Error display... 
    -  baseline 'updated' beside title
        - 'Last Updated: just now'
        - 'x minutes ago'
        = 'x hours ago'
        - 'straight date, if into a next day...





// DONE: Finished
- Add baseline report...
- Get baseline report on dom load
- rename baseline report...
- download baseline file...



Make templates dynamic... Rename, Add new, delete
    - redirect pointer logic...
        - IF logic is suitable for that...

ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
    - Student ID
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Notes

*** just create these excel files when needed or use a template that can be replaceable ?





Tabs:
 - Report processing tab
 - Configuration tab ( change semester dynamic, or templates / template logic pointers...)
