Questions:
-----
    - Manual student add. We talked about adding a ID of some sort to the 'Notes' when adding a student.
        - However, Health insurance main reports DO NOT have a notes column

    - New reports like compare, will there ever be the same student on a new report that has new info that the baseline
        does not have ?


    - Deployment PROS / CONS
        - Hosted:
            - State is shared and easily accessible by everyone
            - 
        
        - Run natively
            - Each user of the app will have their own state.
            - You will need to share excel files manually over email, etc...
            - Pros:
                - No cost
                - Zero downtime / service maintenance

    - Populated_templates
        - Rows -> the row count for the downloadables need to be fixed...
    
    - Remove rows for 'Compare Report' / do something with the space...

To be done:
    -

Production build
 - Two paths:
    - Free tier hosting, have to re upload templates and target values each time. Auth to make private.
    - Paid tier hosting. Templates + target numbers + baselines will be stored. Auth to make private. (My recommendation)



Volume Testing More Legit
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Testing Stage via first prod (free render host)
    - ESL EAPC -> 4 ESL students within 10 block
    - ILAC -> 3 ILAC students ^^
    - POST -> 3 POST students ^^

    - Accounting
        - Fall ->
            - Student 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12
            - Amounts track to balances below...
        - Winter ->
            - Student 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12
            - Amounts track below
        - Summer ->
            - Students 4, 6, 7, 8, 12

    - Rows 2 - 11 (10 rows of unique data)
        - Pasted from Row 2 -> 2986
        - 5 row offset at end -> divide by 2981
            - last 5 -> 
                - 3 ESL
                - 2 ILAC
                - Students 3 - 7


    - TOTALS
        - ESL -> 1192 students + 3 more (offset)
        - ILAC -> 894 students + 2 more (offset)
        - POST -> 894 students

        - accounting:
            - 2086 students + 3 students (offset)
            -Notes: Process -> ILAC -> POST -> ESL

Potential problems
-----
    - excel column names changing 
    - Process logic (What rows are we grabbing ? And what columns, and what do they map too ?)
        - Auto-populated values (insurance - destin country / destin city - Give 'column name': value) ? Or hard code logic ?

    


----------
TODO
    
    - UX for making it even more clear when new files are available ??? Green icon shows up in the boxes are success ?
        - Process finished UX display of some sort...
    - PROD:
        - hosted ???
            - Account to give them. Running on freelo
        - local docker container via a .zip file ?
    

    






ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
