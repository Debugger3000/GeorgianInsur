Questions:
-----
    - Manual student add. We talked about adding a ID of some sort to the 'Notes' when adding a student.
        - However, Health insurance main reports DO NOT have a notes column

    - New reports like compare, will there ever be the same student on a new report that has new info that the baseline
        does not have ?


    - Deployment PROS / CONS
        - Hosted:
            - State is shared and easily accessible by everyone
            - 
        
        - Run natively
            - Each user of the app will have their own state.
            - You will need to share excel files manually over email, etc...
            - Pros:
                - No cost
                - Zero downtime / service maintenance

    - Populated_templates
        - Rows -> the row count for the downloadables need to be fixed...
    
    - Remove rows for 'Compare Report' / do something with the space...


---
To be done:
    - Align green + for baseline / compare
    - Manual student add button to reverse style
    - loading icon on baseline upload
    - change default date for first two templates





--- Meeting - January 9th friday 12:00pm

Potential problems
-----
    - excel column names changing 
    - Process logic (What rows are we grabbing ? And what columns, and what do they map too ?)
        - Auto-populated values (insurance - destin country / destin city - Give 'column name': value) ? Or hard code logic ?

    


----------
TODO
    
    - UX for making it even more clear when new files are available ??? Green icon shows up in the boxes are success ?
        - Process finished UX display of some sort...
    - PROD:
        - hosted ???
            - Account to give them. Running on freelo
        - local docker container via a .zip file ?
    

    






ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
    - Student ID
    - First Name

*** just create these excel files when needed or use a template that can be replaceable ?
