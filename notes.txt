Questions:
-----
    - Manual student add. We talked about adding a ID of some sort to the 'Notes' when adding a student.
        - However, Health insurance main reports DO NOT have a notes column

    - New reports like compare, will there ever be the same student on a new report that has new info that the baseline
        does not have ?

Potential problems
-----
    - excel column names changing 
    - Process logic (What rows are we grabbing ? And what columns, and what do they map too ?)
        - Auto-populated values (insurance - destin country / destin city - Give 'column name': value) ? Or hard code logic ?

    


----------
TODO
    
    - Process in progress-loading indicator. maybe a bit better
    - Process finished UX display of some sort...
        


    - Pop up for "process compare' since it overwrites baseline...
    - UX for making it even more clear when new files are available ??? Green icon shows up in the boxes are success ?

    - PROD:
        - hosted ???
            - Account to give them. Running on freelo
        - local docker container via a .zip file ?
    

    










Make templates dynamic... Rename, Add new, delete
    - redirect pointer logic...
        - IF logic is suitable for that...

ININ Fee Assessment Excel (For accounting)
Columns:
    - Selected Term Desc
    - Student ID
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Notes

*** just create these excel files when needed or use a template that can be replaceable ?
